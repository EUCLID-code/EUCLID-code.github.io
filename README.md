# Introduction
EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification & Discovery) utilizes local displacement and global reaction force data,
but no local stress data as these are not available from experiments, to discover material models without assuming a specific functional form for the model a priori.
To this end, a large catalog of candidate material models is constructed out of which dominant candidates are selected through sparse regression
or the material behavior is described by a general machine learning based ansatz, e.g., a neural network.
To compensate the unavailability of stress data, physics knowledge is employed by minimizing the sum of squared residuals of the weak linear momentum balance.

The figure above shows the workflow of the sparse regression based EUCLID algorithm.
Full-field displacement and net reaction force data that are obtained from a single experiment (a) serve as input data for EUCLID.
The displacement data (b) is interpolated (c) to obtain the displacement field (d) and after differentiation the strain field (e).
A general material model library is constructed, which can describe a variety of different material responses dependent on the choice of material parameters `theta`.
Based on the model library, the stresses (f) and hence the residuals of the weak linear momentum balance (g,h) can be expressed dependent on the unknown parameters `theta`.
The linear momentum balance serves as a physical constraint on the material parameter space.
Minimizing the sum of squared residuals together with a sparsity promoting regularization term (i) yields a sparse parameter vector `theta`
and hence an interpretable constitutive law expressed by a compact mathematical formula (j).

# Applications

## Hyperelasticity
EUCLID was successfully demonstrated to be able to discover strain energy density functions of hyperelastic materials (see Ref. 1.).
The codes and data are publically available on <a href="https://github.com/EUCLID-code/EUCLID-hyperelasticity" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (see Ref. 2.)
and the <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/505693" target="_blank">ETH Research Collection</a> (see Ref. 3.), respectively.
The documentation of the hyperelasticity code and an example can be found <a href="https://EUCLID-code.github.io/EUCLID-hyperelasticity/mkdocs/site" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Bayesian Inference
In Ref. 7., the problem of material model discovery was considered from a Bayesian perspective.
Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, the Bayesian-EUCLID deduces a posterior probability distribution for the unknown material parameters,
which is a joined distribution of the model likelihood and a sparsity promoting spike-and-slab prior.
In this way, parsimonious and interpretable material models can be discovered with quantifiable uncertainties. 
The codes and data are publically available on <a href="https://github.com/EUCLID-code/EUCLID-hyperelasticity-bayesian" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
The documentation of the Bayesian-EUCLID code and an example can be found <a href="https://EUCLID-code.github.io/EUCLID-hyperelasticity-bayesian/mkdocs/site" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Neural networks

In Ref. 8, we demonstrate the use of neural networks for learning the hidden material models from full-field displacement and global reaction force data.
By using an Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) and a physics guided training protocol, we ensure that the learned strain-stress relation fulfills multiple physical constraints. 
Moreover, we present the capability of our ICNN-based material model to learn the hidden fiber angle arrangments of anisotropic hyperelastic materials.
The codes and data are publically available on <a href="https://github.com/EUCLID-code/EUCLID-hyperelasticity-NN" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (see Ref. 8.).

## Viscoelasticity
In Ref. 11, EUCLID is used to identify the material model of a viscoelastic material from full-field displacement and reaction force data in the frequency domain.
Starting from a large library of viscoelastic Maxwell elements, EUCLID automatically selects the most relevant elements using sparse regression and k-means clustering.

## Elasto-Plasticity
In Ref. 4., EUCLID was for the first time applied to discover elasto-plastic material models.
Full-field displacement and global reaction force data are used to discover plastic yield surfaces and hardening laws as closed-form mathematical formulas (see Animation 1).
The codes and data are publically available on <a href="https://github.com/EUCLID-code/EUCLID-plasticity" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (see Ref. 5.)
and the <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/534002" target="_blank">ETH Research Collection</a> (see Ref. 6.), respectively.
The documentation of the elasto-plasticity code and an example can be found <a href="https://EUCLID-code.github.io/EUCLID-plasticity/mkdocs/site" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Generalized Standard Materials
In Ref. 9., the EUCLID framework is extended to generalized standard materials.
In this way, no a priori choice of a material class (such as hyperelasticity or elasto-plasticity) has to be made
and EUCLID can automatically discover the true hidden material model from a large catalog of constitutive classes, including elasticity, viscoelasticity, elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity, isotropic and kinematic hardening.
